# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Meshkit Messaging System

### Overview
Meshkit is a modular messaging system designed to facilitate communication between distributed services using NATS as the core message broker. The system is composed of producer and consumer services, a configuration library, and integration with observability tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. The project is implemented in Kotlin and leverages Gradle for build automation.

---

## 1. Goals & Objectives
- Enable reliable, scalable message passing between microservices.
- Provide a reusable configuration library for service metadata and catalog information.
- Support observability and monitoring through integration with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Ensure ease of deployment and local development using Docker Compose.

---

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Messaging Services
- **Producer Service**: Publishes messages to NATS subjects based on configuration.
- **Consumer Service**: Subscribes to NATS subjects, receives messages, and acknowledges them.
- Both services use a shared configuration library for catalog and entity metadata.

### 2.2 Configuration Library (`libs/config`)
- Provides classes for reading and parsing catalog information (e.g., `CatalogInfo`, `EntityReference`).
- Reads configuration from YAML files (e.g., `catalog-info.yaml`).
- Exposes metadata such as service name and entity reference for use in NATS connection options.

### 2.3 Observability & Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from NATS and related services.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics using pre-configured dashboards (e.g., clients, clusters, JetStream state, network, observations).
- **Surveyor**: Monitors NATS cluster health and performance.

### 2.4 Integration & Deployment
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates NATS, Prometheus, Grafana, and supporting services for local development and testing.
- **JetStream**: Provides persistence and streaming capabilities for NATS.
- **Storage**: Persists Prometheus data for metrics retention.

---

## 3. Architecture
- **Services**: Each service (producer, consumer) is a standalone Kotlin application with its own Gradle build.
- **Configuration**: Shared via the `libs/config` module, imported as a dependency.
- **Integration**: All services and observability tools are coordinated via Docker Compose for seamless local setup.

---

## 4. Usage & Reproduction
1. **Build the Project**:
   - Use Gradle to build all modules: `./gradlew build` from the project root.
2. **Run Integration Environment**:
   - Start all services and observability stack: `docker-compose up` from the `integration/` directory.
3. **Producer/Consumer Services**:
   - Each service reads its configuration from the shared config library and connects to the NATS server.
   - The producer publishes messages to a subject defined in the catalog info.
   - The consumer subscribes to the same subject and processes incoming messages.
4. **Observability**:
   - Access Grafana dashboards at the configured port (see `integration/grafana/provisioning`).
   - Prometheus scrapes metrics from NATS and related services.

---

## 5. File/Directory Structure
- `services/producer/` - Producer service source code and build files.
- `services/consumer/` - Consumer service source code and build files.
- `libs/config/` - Shared configuration library.
- `integration/` - Docker Compose files, Prometheus, Grafana, and supporting resources.
- `prds/` - Product requirements and documentation.

---

## 6. Future Work
- Add authentication and authorization for NATS connections.
- Implement message persistence and replay using JetStream features.
- Expand configuration options for dynamic service discovery.
- Enhance observability with custom metrics and alerts.
